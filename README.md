# Landing Page Project

In this project I built a multi-section landing page.
Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. 
To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. 
I demonstrated this with the navigation menu. 
Most of the changes were on the app.js file but I did some changes to the styles.css and to the index.html as well.
